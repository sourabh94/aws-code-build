# Consolidating AWS CodeBuild use cases and respective buildspec.yml files

This project is for bignners like me who face issues in finding build solutions for AWS CI/CD.

One stop shop for AWS CI/CD build solutions along with the buildspec.yml files.

Docker build : building docker images and pushing them to ECR repository.

Terraform build : terraform apply or destroy using code build.

CloudFormation build : In Progress, not yet uploaded.
